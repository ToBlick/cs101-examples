/**
 * The Snake class represents a simple snake board.
 * The board is played on a grid where the snake (represented by green squares) moves around and tries to eat the food (represented by yellow squares). After eating food, the snake grows by one square.
 * The objective of the board is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the boundaries of the grid or the snake's own body.
 * The board ends when the snake collides with a boundary or its own body.
 * 
 * The board is controlled by the user, who can make the snake move up, down, left, or right using the 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys respectively.
 * 
 * The Snake class provides methods for initializing the board, printing the board state, updating the board state based on user input, and checking for win or loss conditions.
 * 
 * The board is played by calling the main method of the Snake class.
 * 
 * Example usage:
 * 
 * int[][] myBoard = new int[9][9];
 * Snake.initBoard(myBoard);
 * Snake.putFood(myBoard);
 * boolean validInput = true;
 * while (validInput) {
 *     Snake.printboard(myBoard);
 *     validInput = Snake.userMove(myBoard);
 *     if (Snake.checkWin(myBoard)) {
 *         System.out.println("You win! :)");
 *         return;
 *     }
 * }
 * System.out.println("You lose :(");
