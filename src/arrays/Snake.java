/**
 * The Snake class represents a simple snake game.
 * The game is played on a grid where the snake (represented by green squares) moves around and tries to eat the food (represented by yellow squares).
 * The objective of the board is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the boundaries of the grid or the snake's own body.
 * The game ends when the snake collides with a boundary or its own body or when it fills up the entire board.
 * The user can make the snake move up, down, left, or right using the 'w', 'a', 's', and 'd' keys respectively.
 * Internally, the game is represented by a 2D array of integers. The snake is represented by positive integers that decrease by one from the snake's head to its tail. The food is represented by -1. The field is represented by 0. Whenever the snake moves, the cell in the direction it is moving becomes its new head with a value one greater than the previous head. After every move, the value of every snake-cell is decremented by one. If the value of a snake-cell becomes zero, the snake has moved off that cell. If the snake eats food, the value of every snake-cell is incremented by one, effectivelt growing it in length by one cell.
 * The game is played by calling the main method of the Snake class.
